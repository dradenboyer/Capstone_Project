Hey everyone my name is Draden
This is my capstone project from my first 8 weeks at DevMountain.
Here I have created a website that allows you to play in virtual form the magic 8 ball.
The simple yet fate tellingball that has all the answers to the universe and even the ability to predict ones future that made quite
the hit around the world. I created this magic 8 ball website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
I made request to my server through axios and express.

The website is very user friendly and has simple instructions. We think to ourselves a yes or no question we then proceed
by hovering over the magic 8 ball, then wth some css tricks it begins to shake all the answers it has inside of it. 

When we move the mouse cursor out of the magic 8 ball we recieve an answer to all of our problems, or maybe just the answer to 
if i was going to recieve good sleep tonight.. 

I thought of back to when i would use the magic 8 ball with friends and family that it would be funny to create your own responses
to mess around with whoever would use it. Instead of breaking this ball open and writing our own answers inside of it. Here we have an example.


We break open
the code by using a post request to add some of our own responses to the magic answering machine. Wanna delete one of the responsed you added?
Click the x and it will trigger the super awesome delete request. Which then removes it from our screen and the magic answering machine will
forget it even exist. 

Thats it from me, thank you for watching
